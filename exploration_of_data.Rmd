1. Zoo Animal Classification - This dataset is from UCI and it has two sections. One of the csv contains a list of 101 annimals from a zoo. It includes variables about these animals such as if they have hair, if they have a backbone, and so on. Seven classes of animals are represented in the dataset, including mammals, birds, and reptiles.

For this problem I could use a cool tree, and then use Linear Discriminant Analysis as a new method. (?)
